        <h4>The Aphrodite of Knidos (or Cnidus) was an Ancient Greek sculpture of the goddess Aphrodite created by
          Praxiteles of Athens around the 4th century BCE. It is one of the first life-sized representations of the nude
          female form in Greek history, displaying an alternative idea to male heroic nudity. Praxiteles' Aphrodite is
          shown nude, reaching for a bath towel while covering her pubis, which, in turn leaves her breasts exposed.
          Up until this point, Greek sculpture had been dominated by male nude figures. The original Greek sculpture
          is no longer in existence; however, many Roman copies survive of this influential work of art. Variants of
          the Venus Pudica (suggesting an action to cover the breasts) are the Venus de' Medici and the Capitoline
          Venus.
